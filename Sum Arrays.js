// Assumptions
// You can assume that you are only given numbers.
// You cannot assume the size of the array.
// You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.
// What We're Testing
// We're testing basic loops and math operations. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and math operations.
// Advanced users may find this extremely easy and can easily write this in one line.

// Sum Numbers
function sum(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }

  return sum;
}
